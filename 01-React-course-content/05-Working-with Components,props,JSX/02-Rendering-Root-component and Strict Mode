## Section-05 02-Rendering Root Component and Strict Mode

- create react app
- delete all files in src so start from scratch

- then create our first file inside src folder named index.js
  because Webpack , which is module bundler in this project
  expects the entry point to be called index.js

- import React from react
- import ReactDOM from react-dom/client

- create react app fuction or component
  component name have to be in Pascal Case.
  component name to be start with uppercase letter

// using React Version 18

- Render it now to the DOM when write the component.

-React.StrictMode is a part of react
during development React.StrictMode it will render or components
twice in order to find certain bugs and also react will check
if we are using outdated parts of the React API
-Good idea to always activated React.StrictMode during develope
react applications.
