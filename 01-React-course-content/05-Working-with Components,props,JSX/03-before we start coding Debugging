## Section-05 03-Before Start coding debugging

- if page does not update when you do some changes and don't
  panic but try out some solution

- First: Make Sure That the Application is actullay running
- ctrl + c to stop runnning a running appliction and then
  restart you application that can be solved you first problem.

- Secondly: Hard Reload the browser is one of the solution
- Tip: alway open the termianl all the time. and same for
  the dev tool in the browser.

- create react app actually has some internal thing which will
  automatically display errors right here.
  like: Return more than one element.. if error then take the error message and search in
  google or chatgpt.

- Another important tip is to always work with Eslint
  So Eslint enabled by default.
  also it show the problems in the code show in problem tab
  in the terminal.

- When you have a yellow line on the varibale we should check
  what's gooing on there. sometime prettier extension stop working then it's
  good idea to goto output tab then select one of the process that is running in
  vs code for example our saying prettier.
  same for Eslint also.
