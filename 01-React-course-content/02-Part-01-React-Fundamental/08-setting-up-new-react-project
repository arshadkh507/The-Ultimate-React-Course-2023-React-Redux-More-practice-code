Section-02 Setting up New React Project The Options

1. create-react-app
2. vite

3. Create-React-App: Complete starter kit for react application.

- Everything is already configure: ESLint , Prettier , Jest , etc.
- So an app created with create-react-app automatically comes with a development
  server, Webpack , module bundling and of course important developer tools which include
  a linter like ESlint , a code formater like prettier , a testing library like jest and
  of course Babel for enabling the latest Javascipt.
- uses some slow and kind of outdated technology under the hood and in particular the webpack bundler.
- the team behind create-react-app stop innovating it and the recommendation is don't use create-react-app
  for real world project anymore.

2. Vite: modern build tool that contains a template for setting up react application

- Need to manually set up ESLint (and other).
- Extremely fast hot module replacement (HMR) and bundling.
- use for modern real world apps

What aboout react frameworks?
Next.js  
Remix

- The react team now advises to use a react framework for new project.
  having solution like routing ,data fetching and server side rendering.
- So react framewroks are framwork build on top of react library to make it even easier
  to build apps then just vanilla react itself.

  For learning it's not necessary to use these react framworks but for production or real world
  project it's beneficial.
