Liabrary for building user interfaces.Created by Facebook

1.  Components Based Desing . React is all about component. Component is all about building
    blocks of user interfaces in React. Such as buttons , input fields , search box and so on.
    And in fact, basically all React does is to take components and draw then on a web page.

- Since we build complex UIs by combining multiple components, Each components must have
  all the informatin about what it looks like.

- What each component looks like and how it works we use a special declarative syntax called JSX.
- Declarative: means we telling React what a component should look like, based on current data/state.
  React is absraction away from the DOM: we never touch the DOM. So we simply tell react what we want
  to happen when some data changes but how to do it.

- JSX: a syntax that combines HTML , CSS , Javasript as well as referencing other components

2. State: if we never touch the DOM , then how does React Update the UI?
   Well , that's where the concept of state comes into play.

- Main goal of React is to always keep the UI in sync with data. And from now on, Let's
  actually call that data state.
