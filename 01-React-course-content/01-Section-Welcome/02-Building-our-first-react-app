Section-01 Welcome
Buiding our first react app have subtitles file.

Now before learning anything about react and even before setting up
our development enviroment , let's build our very first small React App!.

It is a tiny app But you will already meet many of the fundamental ingredients
all react applications are build upon. so this is going to be alot of fun already
add so Let's get started.

And remember how i said that we don't even need to setup ou development enviroment
in Online Code editor called codesandbox.io
and right now you can go to codesandbox.io and there they will ask you to try this app
for free, but you can do it even more easily which is.

--> open new tab write react.new and enter it will automatically create new codesandbox for you.
--> let's build our first component which a piece of user interface (UI)

-in react these fuction return something called JSX which is syntax look like HTML .
-which will basically descibe what we can see on the screen. so just like HTML
-when we fetch data from any api and we want to display it in user interface then we use
a concept called state. State is the most fundatament concept of react. So Whenever we need to change
in the user interface, we change the state. so we update something called the state.

-JSX is just like HTML but we can add some javascript to it when we want to use javascript in it
then we can enter a javascript mode by using curly braces {}.

-In react we divided User Interface something called Components.
Convention in react for component name should be in uppercase. for example: function Message () {}.
